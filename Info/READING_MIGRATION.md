## Routing
The routing structure remains the same:

## Data Structure
The new system expects test data in the following format:
```typescript
interface IeltsTest {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  timeLimit: number; // in seconds
  sections: IeltsSection[];
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- API integration for dynamic test content

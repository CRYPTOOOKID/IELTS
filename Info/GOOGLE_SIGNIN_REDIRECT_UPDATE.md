# Google Sign-In: Popup to Redirect Migration

## Problem
The Google Sign-In popup method was being blocked by Content Security Policy (CSP) and Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) browser security policies, causing these errors:

```
Refused to frame 'https://spinta-84f45.firebaseapp.com/' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'". Note that 'frame-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.

Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call.

Firebase: Error (auth/popup-closed-by-user).
```

## Solution
Switched from `signInWithPopup` to `signInWithRedirect` method which is more compatible with modern browser security policies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Firebase Auth Imports
**File:** `AppFrontend/src/components/Auth/AuthContext.jsx`

```javascript
// Before:
import { signInWithPopup } from 'firebase/auth';

// After:
import { signInWithRedirect, getRedirectResult } from 'firebase/auth';
```

### 2. Updated signInWithGoogle Function
**File:** `AppFrontend/src/components/Auth/AuthContext.jsx`

The function now:
- Uses `signInWithRedirect(auth, googleProvider)` instead of `signInWithPopup`
- Redirects the user to Google's authentication page
- Does not return a result immediately (user leaves the page)

### 3. Added Redirect Result Handler
**File:** `AppFrontend/src/components/Auth/AuthContext.jsx`

New function `handleGoogleRedirectResult()` that:
- Checks for redirect results when the page loads
- Processes successful authentication after user returns from Google
- Handles any errors that occurred during redirect flow

### 4. Updated useEffect to Handle Redirects
**File:** `AppFrontend/src/components/Auth/AuthContext.jsx`

The auth context now automatically checks for redirect results on page load:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // ... existing auth state listener ...
  
  // Check for Google Sign-In redirect result when component mounts
  const checkRedirectResult = async () => {
    try {
      await handleGoogleRedirectResult();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error handling redirect result:', error);
    }
  };

  checkRedirectResult();
  // ... cleanup ...
}, []);
```

### 5. Updated Login Page Handler
**File:** `AppFrontend/src/components/Auth/LoginPage.jsx`

Updated `handleGoogleSignIn` to work with redirect flow.

## User Experience Changes

### Before (Popup):
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Popup window opens with Google sign-in
3. User signs in within popup
4. Popup closes, user stays on same page
5. Authentication completes

### After (Redirect):
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. User is redirected to Google's sign-in page
3. User signs in on Google's page
4. User is redirected back to the app
5. App detects redirect result and completes authentication

## Benefits

1. **Better Compatibility**: Works with strict CSP and COOP policies
2. **No Popup Blockers**: Not affected by browser popup blocking
3. **Mobile Friendly**: Better experience on mobile devices
4. **More Reliable**: Less prone to security policy blocking

## Testing

1. Test the sign-in flow in production environment
2. Verify it works with the CSP policies in place
3. Test on both desktop and mobile browsers
4. Ensure proper error handling for failed authentications

## Notes

- The redirect method changes the user experience slightly (they leave the site temporarily)
- All existing error handling and user state management remains the same
- No changes needed to other parts of the application
- Firebase automatically handles the redirect flow and authentication state

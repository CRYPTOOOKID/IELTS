# Google Sign-In Redirect Debugging Guide

## Issue
After successful Google Sign-In, users remain on the login page instead of being redirected to `/skills`.

## Changes Made for Debugging

### 1. Enhanced AuthContext Logging
**File:** `AppFrontend/src/components/Auth/AuthContext.jsx`

Added detailed console logging for:
- Auth state listener setup and cleanup
- Auth state changes (user login/logout)
- Google redirect result checking
- User object creation and updates
- Error handling

### 2. Enhanced LoginPage Logging
**File:** `AppFrontend/src/components/Auth/LoginPage.jsx`

Added logging for:
- User state changes in useEffect
- Loading state monitoring
- Navigation attempts
- Google Sign-In button clicks

### 3. Improved Redirect Result Handling
**File:** `AppFrontend/src/components/Auth/AuthContext.jsx`

Enhanced `handleGoogleRedirectResult` to:
- Manually set user state immediately after successful redirect
- Set loading to false after processing
- Clear any existing errors
- Provide detailed error logging

## Console Messages to Check

When testing in production at https://www.spinta.org/login?tab=signin, look for these console messages:

### On Page Load:
```
AuthContext useEffect: Setting up auth state listener
Checking for redirect result...
```

### If No Redirect Result:
```
No redirect result found
Auth state changed: No user
LoginPage useEffect: User state changed: null
LoginPage useEffect: Loading state: false
```

### When Clicking Google Sign-In:
```
Google Sign-In button clicked
Starting Google Sign-In redirect...
Google Sign-In redirect initiated successfully
```

### After Returning from Google (Success):
```
Checking for redirect result...
Google Sign-In successful via redirect: [User Object]
Setting user in AuthContext: [User Object]
Redirect result found: [Auth Result]
Auth state changed: User: user@example.com
LoginPage useEffect: User state changed: [User Object]
LoginPage useEffect: Loading state: false
User is authenticated, navigating to /skills
```

### If Redirect Fails:
```
Google Sign-In Redirect Error: [Error Object]
Error code: [error.code]
Error message: [error.message]
```

## Debugging Steps

1. **Open Browser DevTools** → Console tab
2. **Navigate to** https://www.spinta.org/login?tab=signin
3. **Click the Google Sign-In button**
4. **Complete Google authentication**
5. **Check console messages** when returning to the app

## Expected Flow

1. `Google Sign-In button clicked` - Button works
2. `Starting Google Sign-In redirect...` - Redirect initiated
3. User redirected to Google → Signs in → Redirected back
4. `Checking for redirect result...` - App checks for result
5. `Google Sign-In successful via redirect: ...` - Result found
6. `Setting user in AuthContext: ...` - User state updated
7. `User is authenticated, navigating to /skills` - Navigation triggered

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: No Redirect Result Detected
**Symptoms:** Only see "No redirect result found"
**Possible Causes:**
- Firebase auth domain not whitelisted
- Browser blocking cookies/storage
- CSP still blocking Firebase connections

### Issue 2: User State Not Updating
**Symptoms:** See redirect result but no user state change
**Solution:** Check if `setUser()` is being called correctly

### Issue 3: Navigation Not Triggered
**Symptoms:** User state updates but no navigation
**Possible Causes:**
- React Router navigation issue
- Loading state interference
- Component re-rendering issues

### Issue 4: Auth State Listener Not Firing
**Symptoms:** Manual user state set but onAuthStateChanged doesn't fire
**Solution:** Firebase auth state might need manual refresh

## Manual Testing Commands

You can also test manually in the browser console:

```javascript
// Check current auth state
console.log('Current user:', firebase.auth().currentUser);

// Check for redirect result manually
firebase.auth().getRedirectResult().then(result => {
  console.log('Manual redirect check:', result);
});
```

## Files Modified

1. `AppFrontend/src/components/Auth/AuthContext.jsx` - Enhanced logging and state management
2. `AppFrontend/src/components/Auth/LoginPage.jsx` - Added navigation debugging
3. `AppFrontend/index.html` - Fixed CSP for Google Analytics
4. `AppFrontend/netlify.toml` - Updated CSP configuration

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the build with enhanced logging
2. Test Google Sign-In flow in production
3. Check browser console for the debug messages
4. Identify where the flow breaks
5. Apply targeted fixes based on the console output
